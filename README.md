# Progress polyfill

This is a polyfill for implementing the HTML5 `<progress>` element in browsers that do not currently support it.

# Usage

Using it is easy â€” simply include the `progress-polyfill.js` file in the HEAD of the HTML page. You can then use `<progress>` elements normally.

The script will look through each `<progress>` element on the page and construct its own graphical meter using two `<div>` elements. This is then added as a child of the `<progress>` element, to serve as a fallback. Browsers that support `<progress>` elements will still show them natively, while browsers that don't support them will instead show our `<div>` meters.

A default css file is provided. You may edit this file to style the meters to make them look the way you want.

## Manual usage

The script can also be called manually as a jQuery plugin for elements dynamically generated through script. Simply call the `.html5Progress()` method on any jQuery object containing one or more `<progress>` elements.

## Dependencies

This script requires only the jQuery[http://jquery.com/] library.
